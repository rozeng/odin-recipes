      <li>4 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
      <li>1 dried de árbol chile, stemmed and seeded (Optional)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 medium white onion, quartered, divided</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>¼ cup crispy tortilla strips (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
      <li>6 lime wedges, for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add chicken broth to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high. Remove from heat and add dried chiles. Cover and let sit until chiles have softened, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add 3 of the onion quarters, reserving the last quarter for later use, and garlic to pan. Cook, flipping once, until charred, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat (do not wipe out the pot), and transfer onion and garlic to a blender. Add chicken broth, chiles, tomatoes, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, oregano, pepper, and cloves. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Process until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil in to the large pot; heat over medium-high. Add chicken; cook, flipping once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Pour blended chile mixture over meat chicken and top with bay leaf. Cover and cook over medium-low until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, chop remaining onion quarter. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Uncover pot, discard bay leaf, and remove chicken from chile mixture and shred. Divide shredded chicken evenly among 6 bowls, and ladle in the soup over chicken in bowls. Top with reserved chopped onion, tortilla strips, if desired, cilantro and serve with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
